# Custom Voice Generation Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented ElevenLabs Voice Design API integration to generate custom, unique voices for each AI persona based on their characteristics extracted from Exa.ai research.

## What Was Built

### 1. Voice Generation API Endpoint

#### `/api/elevenlabs/generate-voice` (POST)

- **Purpose**: Generates custom voices using ElevenLabs Voice Design API
- **Input**: `{ voiceDescription: string, previewText: string, gender?: string }`
- **Process**:
  1. Receives voice description (e.g., "middle-aged male with American accent, authoritative tone")
  2. Sends to ElevenLabs Voice Design API
  3. Returns generated voice_id and sample audio URL
- **Error Handling**:
  - Detects plan limitations (403/402 errors)
  - Returns fallback flag for graceful degradation
  - Logs detailed error information

### 2. Enhanced Persona Analysis

#### Updated `buildPersonaFromExa()` in `/src/lib/personas.ts`

Added voice characteristics analysis to Groq prompt:

- **Age range**: young adult (20-35), middle-aged (36-55), mature (56+)
- **Vocal pace**: fast, moderate, slow
- **Energy level**: high-energy, measured, calm
- **Accent**: American, British, neutral, other
- **Tone qualities**: authoritative, warm, friendly, professional, confident, etc.
- **Vocal texture**: smooth, clear, resonant, raspy, soft

**New Return Fields**:

- `voiceDescription`: Formatted description for voice generation
- `sampleText`: 100-150 character preview text for voice testing

### 3. Intelligent Voice Assignment

#### Updated `/api/personas/create` Endpoint

Now follows this process:

1. **Research**: Exa.ai gathers information about the person
2. **Analysis**: Groq analyzes personality and voice characteristics
3. **Voice Generation**: Attempts to create custom voice via ElevenLabs
4. **Fallback**: If generation fails, uses gender-based default voices
5. **Save**: Stores persona with assigned voice_id

**Fallback Strategy** (3-tier):

- **Tier 1**: Custom generated voice (ideal)
- **Tier 2**: Female default voice (Sherry's voice)
- **Tier 3**: Male default voice (generic)

### 4. Enhanced UI

#### Updated `CreatePersonaModal.tsx`

- Shows "Researching persona and generating custom voice..." during creation
- Logs custom voice generation success in console
- Increased success display time to 1.5 seconds

## User Flow

```
User enters "Jeff Bezos"
  ‚Üì
Exa.ai researches Jeff Bezos
  ‚Üì
Groq analyzes and generates:
  - Personality traits
  - System prompt
  - Gender: male
  - Voice description: "middle-aged male with American accent, authoritative and measured tone"
  - Sample text: "We need to be stubborn on vision but flexible on details"
  ‚Üì
ElevenLabs Voice Design generates custom voice
  ‚Üì
Save persona with custom voice_id
  ‚Üì
When user chats, Jeff Bezos speaks with unique voice!
```

## Technical Implementation

### Voice Description Format

```
"[age] [gender] with [accent] accent, [tone] and [quality] tone, [pace] delivery"

Example:
"middle-aged male with American accent, authoritative and confident tone, measured delivery"
```

### Sample Groq Response

```json
{
  "styleBullets": ["Long-term thinking", "Customer obsession", ...],
  "taboo": ["Short-term profit focus", ...],
  "systemPrompt": "You are Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon...",
  "gender": "male",
  "voiceDescription": "middle-aged male with American accent, authoritative tone, measured delivery",
  "sampleText": "We need to be stubborn on vision but flexible on details. Customer obsession drives everything we do."
}
```

### API Call Chain

```
1. POST /api/personas/create
   ‚Üì
2. buildPersonaFromExa() ‚Üí Groq analysis
   ‚Üì
3. POST /api/elevenlabs/generate-voice
   ‚Üì
4. ElevenLabs Voice Design API
   ‚Üì
5. createPersona() ‚Üí Save to Supabase
```

## Files Created

- `/src/app/api/elevenlabs/generate-voice/route.ts` - Voice generation endpoint
- `/VOICE_GENERATION_FEATURE.md` - This documentation

## Files Modified

- `/src/lib/personas.ts` - Added voice characteristics analysis
- `/src/app/api/personas/create/route.ts` - Integrated voice generation with fallback
- `/src/components/CreatePersonaModal.tsx` - Enhanced UI messaging

## Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented

- Custom voice generation based on persona characteristics
- Age-appropriate voice selection
- Accent matching
- Tone and energy level matching
- Graceful fallback to default voices
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Error handling for plan limitations

### üéØ Benefits

1. **Unique voices**: Each persona gets a custom voice matching their characteristics
2. **Better immersion**: Age, accent, and tone match the real person
3. **Automatic**: No manual voice selection needed
4. **Robust**: Falls back gracefully if generation fails
5. **Scalable**: Works for any persona created

## Requirements

### ElevenLabs Plan

- **Voice Generation** requires **Creator plan** ($22/mo) or higher
- Free tier only provides pre-made voices
- Check plan at: https://elevenlabs.io/pricing

### Environment Variables

```bash
ELEVEN_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
EXA_API_KEY=your_exa_api_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

## Testing

### Test Custom Voice Generation

1. Create a new persona (e.g., "Oprah Winfrey")
2. Check console logs:
   ```
   [Persona Creation] Building persona from Exa...
   [Persona Creation] Attempting custom voice generation...
   [Persona Creation] Voice desc: mature female with American accent, warm and enthusiastic tone
   [Voice Gen] Generating custom voice...
   [Voice Gen] Success! Voice ID: xyz123
   [Persona Creation] ‚úÖ Custom voice generated: xyz123
   ```
3. Chat with persona and hear custom voice

### Test Fallback

If voice generation fails (plan limitation or error):

```
[Persona Creation] ‚ö†Ô∏è Voice generation failed, using fallback
```

Persona still works with default female/male voice.

## Debugging

### Check Voice Generation

```bash
# Check console logs during persona creation
# Look for these messages:
[Persona Creation] Attempting custom voice generation...
[Voice Gen] Generating custom voice...
[Voice Gen] Success! Voice ID: xyz123
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Voice generation requires a higher ElevenLabs plan"

- **Solution**: Upgrade to Creator plan or use fallback voices

**Issue**: Voice generation takes too long

- **Solution**: Normal, can take 5-10 seconds to generate

**Issue**: Generated voice doesn't match expectations

- **Solution**: Groq's voice description may need refinement; check voiceDescription in logs

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Add voice preview before saving persona
- [ ] Allow manual voice regeneration
- [ ] Store multiple voice variations per persona
- [ ] Add voice rating/feedback system
- [ ] Cache generated voices to avoid regeneration
- [ ] Add voice customization sliders (stability, clarity, etc.)
- [ ] Support voice cloning from audio samples
- [ ] Add A/B testing for voice descriptions

## Performance

- **Exa Research**: ~2-3 seconds
- **Groq Analysis**: ~1-2 seconds
- **Voice Generation**: ~5-10 seconds
- **Total**: ~8-15 seconds per persona creation

Fallback to default voices reduces this to ~3-5 seconds if voice generation is skipped or fails.
