# Emotion Tags & Enhanced Persona System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the persona system to support emotion/delivery tags for richer voice synthesis while maintaining clean UI text display. The system now fully utilizes style bullets and taboo topics during conversations.

## Changes Made

### 1. Description Field ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/personas/create/route.ts`
- **Status:** Already implemented correctly
- The `description` field is properly saved to the database (line 151)
- Migration `0007_add_persona_description.sql` adds the column

### 2. Style Bullets & Taboo Integration ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Line 39: Updated database query to fetch `style_bullets` and `taboo` alongside `system_prompt`
- Lines 67-73: Added context builders that append style bullets and taboo topics to system prompt
- Line 80: System message now includes: base prompt + style context + taboo context + emotion instructions

**Example output:**
```
You are Warren Buffett...

Communication Style:
- Uses folksy metaphors and simple language
- Often references baseball and bridge
- Emphasizes long-term thinking
- ...

Topics to Avoid:
- Giving specific stock tips
- Making short-term predictions
- ...

IMPORTANT: Use emotion tags like [chuckles], [thoughtfully]...
```

### 3. Emotion Tag Instructions in Persona Generation ✅
**File:** `src/lib/personas.ts`

**Changes:**
- Line 316: Updated systemPrompt generation instructions
- Now instructs Groq to include emotion annotation guidance in every persona's system prompt
- New personas will automatically be instructed to use tags like `[sarcastically]`, `[giggles]`, `[whispers]`, etc.

**Example instruction added:**
> "IMPORTANT: Instruct the AI to add emotion/delivery tags like [sarcastically], [giggles], [whispers], [excitedly], [thoughtfully], [softly], [chuckles] etc. throughout responses to capture vocal nuances and indicate HOW things are said."

### 4. Runtime Emotion Tag Reminder ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Line 75: Added `emotionInstructions` constant
- Appended to every chat request's system message as reinforcement
- Ensures the AI consistently uses emotion tags even in ongoing conversations

### 5. Emotion Tag Stripping Utility ✅
**File:** `src/lib/utils.ts`

**Added function:**
```typescript
export function stripEmotionTags(text: string): string {
  return text.replace(/\[[\w\s]+\]/g, '').replace(/\s{2,}/g, ' ').trim();
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Removes all bracketed emotion tags from text
- Cleans up multiple spaces left by tag removal
- Used for UI display only

### 6. Clean UI Display ✅
**File:** `src/components/ChatList.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Line 7: Imported `stripEmotionTags` utility
- Line 93: Applied to message content before display

**Result:**
- Users see: "That's interesting. Well, based on my experience... it's not quite that simple."
- Database stores: "That's interesting. [thoughtfully] Well, based on my experience... [chuckles] it's not quite that simple."

### 7. TTS Preservation ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`

**Status:** No changes needed
- Line 28: Text passed directly to ElevenLabs without modification
- Emotion tags remain intact for voice modulation
- ElevenLabs API supports emotion tags in square brackets for enhanced prosody

## Data Flow

### Persona Creation Flow:
```
User Input → Exa API (research) → Groq API (generate with emotion instructions) 
→ Database (stores system_prompt with emotion guidance, style_bullets, taboo, description)
→ Voice Generation (if applicable)
```

### Chat Flow:
```
User Message → Database → Fetch persona (system_prompt, style_bullets, taboo)
→ Build enhanced prompt → Groq API (generates response WITH emotion tags)
→ Save to DB (with tags) → Return to frontend
```

### Display Flow:
```
Message from DB (with tags) → ChatList component → stripEmotionTags()
→ Clean text displayed to user
```

### TTS Flow:
```
Message from DB (with tags) → TTS API → ElevenLabs (processes emotion tags)
→ Audio with enhanced prosody → User hears expressive speech
```

## Example Response

**AI generates:**
```
Oh, that's a fascinating question! [excitedly] You know, I've been thinking about this for years. 
[thoughtfully] The key is... [pauses] well, it's not as simple as most people think. [chuckles] 
Let me break it down for you.
```

**User sees in UI:**
```
Oh, that's a fascinating question! You know, I've been thinking about this for years. 
The key is... well, it's not as simple as most people think. Let me break it down for you.
```

**TTS receives (with tags):**
```
Oh, that's a fascinating question! [excitedly] You know, I've been thinking about this for years. 
[thoughtfully] The key is... [pauses] well, it's not as simple as most people think. [chuckles] 
Let me break it down for you.
```

## Supported Emotion Tags

Common tags the AI will use:
- `[sarcastically]` - Sarcastic tone
- `[giggles]` / `[chuckles]` / `[laughs]` - Laughter variants
- `[whispers]` / `[softly]` - Quiet delivery
- `[excitedly]` - Excited/enthusiastic
- `[thoughtfully]` - Contemplative pause
- `[sighs]` - Audible sigh
- `[pauses]` - Brief silence
- `[warmly]` - Warm/friendly tone
- `[seriously]` - Serious tone shift
- `[playfully]` - Playful/teasing

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Description field saves correctly during persona creation
- [x] Style bullets appear in system prompt during chat
- [x] Taboo topics appear in system prompt during chat
- [x] Emotion instructions included in system prompt
- [x] No linting errors in modified files
- [ ] Manual: Create new persona and verify emotion tags in responses
- [ ] Manual: Verify UI displays clean text without tags
- [ ] Manual: Verify TTS audio includes emotional inflection
- [ ] Manual: Test with different persona styles

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Enhanced system prompt builder
2. ✅ `src/lib/personas.ts` - Updated persona generation instructions
3. ✅ `src/lib/utils.ts` - Added stripEmotionTags utility
4. ✅ `src/components/ChatList.tsx` - Strip tags for display
5. ✅ `src/app/api/tts/route.ts` - Verified tag preservation (no changes needed)

## Benefits

1. **Richer Voice Synthesis**: ElevenLabs receives emotion tags for more natural, expressive speech
2. **Clean UI**: Users see polished text without technical markup
3. **Better Persona Adherence**: Style bullets and taboo topics guide AI behavior
4. **Authentic Conversations**: Emotion tags capture HOW things are said, not just what
5. **Minimal Code Impact**: Changes isolated to specific functions with clear purposes

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add emotion tag visualization toggle in UI (show/hide tags for debugging)
2. Create analytics on which emotion tags are most commonly used per persona
3. Add custom emotion tag definitions per persona
4. Implement emotion tag validation to ensure ElevenLabs supports them
5. A/B test user satisfaction with vs without emotion tags in TTS

## Technical Notes

- Emotion tags use square bracket format: `[emotion]`
- Regex pattern: `/\[[\w\s]+\]/g` matches any word/space characters in brackets
- Database stores full text with tags (original content preserved)
- Frontend strips tags client-side (no server overhead)
- ElevenLabs processes tags server-side during TTS generation
- Tags are preserved in conversation history for context continuity
