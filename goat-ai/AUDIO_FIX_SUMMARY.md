# Audio Playback Fix Summary

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** App not reading messages out loud

## Problem

Assistant messages were not playing audio despite TTS being generated.

## Root Causes

### 1. Database Field Name Mismatch
- **File:** `src/app/api/messages/route.ts` (line 19)
- **Issue:** Saving content as `text` field when database uses `content`
- **Impact:** Messages weren't being saved properly, breaking the entire flow

### 2. Demo Mode State Not Updating
- **File:** `src/app/chat/page.tsx` (handleSendMessage)
- **Issue:** In-memory messages added but UI state not refreshed
- **Impact:** New messages with audio weren't appearing in the UI

### 3. AudioPlayer Missing State Management
- **File:** `src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx`
- **Issue:** No play/pause state tracking, no autoplay error handling
- **Impact:** Couldn't tell if audio was playing, browser autoplay restrictions not handled

## Fixes

### 1. Fixed Database Field (CRITICAL)
```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
text: content,

// After (CORRECT)
content,
```

### 2. Fixed Demo Mode Updates
```typescript
// After sending user message
if (demoMode) {
  const updatedConversation = await getConversation(conversationId);
  setConversation(updatedConversation);
}

// After adding assistant message
if (demoMode) {
  const updatedConversation = await getConversation(conversationId);
  setConversation(updatedConversation);
}
```

### 3. Enhanced AudioPlayer
- ✅ Added `isPlaying` state
- ✅ Event listeners for play/pause/ended
- ✅ Toggle Play/Pause icon based on state
- ✅ 100ms delay for autoplay to ensure loading
- ✅ Graceful handling of browser autoplay restrictions
- ✅ Changed preload to "metadata" for faster response

### 4. Added Diagnostic Logging
- TTS generation logs (voice_id, status, audioUrl length)
- ChatList message logs (audio presence tracking)
- Error logs for TTS failures

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Send a message in demo mode
- [ ] Verify assistant response appears
- [ ] Verify audio icon appears on assistant message
- [ ] Verify audio plays automatically (or shows Play button if blocked)
- [ ] Click Play button manually if autoplay blocked
- [ ] Check browser console for logs:
  - "Generating TTS with voice_id: ..."
  - "TTS generated, audioUrl length: ..."
  - "ChatList messages: ..." (showing hasAudio: true)
- [ ] Test in different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- [ ] Test with real Supabase data (not just demo mode)

## How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Check Console Logs
When you send a message, you should see:
```
Generating TTS with voice_id: XYZ123
TTS generated, audioUrl length: 50000+
ChatList messages: [{ id: '...', role: 'assistant', hasAudio: true, audioUrlLength: 50000+ }]
```

### 2. Visual Indicators
- Assistant message should have a small circular button with Play icon
- When playing, icon should change to Pause
- Button should be blue and hover-able

### 3. Audio Playback
- Audio should start automatically (if browser allows)
- If blocked, console will show: "Autoplay blocked by browser"
- Manual click on Play button should work

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "Autoplay blocked by browser"
- **Normal behavior** in modern browsers
- User needs to interact with page first (send a message, click something)
- After first interaction, subsequent messages should autoplay

### No audio icon appears
- Check console for "hasAudio: false"
- Verify TTS is generating: "TTS generated, audioUrl length"
- Check ElevenLabs API key is set

### Audio icon appears but won't play
- Open browser console and click Play
- Look for errors in console
- Verify audioUrl is a valid base64 data URL

## Files Changed

1. `src/app/api/messages/route.ts` - Database field fix
2. `src/components/AudioPlayer.tsx` - State management & autoplay handling  
3. `src/app/chat/page.tsx` - Demo mode fixes & logging
4. `src/components/ChatList.tsx` - Diagnostic logging

## Next Steps

- Test thoroughly in demo mode
- Test with real Supabase database
- Consider adding visual loading indicator while TTS generates
- Consider adding audio waveform visualization
- Monitor logs for any recurring issues
