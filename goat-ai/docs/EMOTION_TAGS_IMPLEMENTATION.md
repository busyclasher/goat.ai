# Emotion & Delivery System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the persona system to support emotion/delivery cues for richer voice synthesis while maintaining clean UI text display. The system now uses **narrative context** (ElevenLabs best practice) instead of explicit bracket tags, and fully utilizes style bullets and taboo topics during conversations.

## ⚠️ Critical Fix: Narrative Context vs Bracket Tags

### The Problem
Previously, the system used square bracket tags like `[chuckles]`, `[thoughtfully]`, etc. However, **ElevenLabs reads these tags aloud** instead of interpreting them as emotion instructions.

### The Solution
According to [ElevenLabs documentation](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/overview), the correct approach is to use **narrative context** that the AI can interpret naturally:

❌ **Old approach (gets read aloud):**
```
That's interesting. [chuckles] Well, based on my experience... [thoughtfully] it's not that simple.
```

✅ **New approach (interpreted, not read):**
```
"That's interesting," she chuckled. "Well, based on my experience..." She paused thoughtfully. "It's not that simple."
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Description Field ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/personas/create/route.ts`
- **Status:** Already implemented correctly
- The `description` field is properly saved to the database (line 151)
- Migration `0007_add_persona_description.sql` adds the column

### 2. Style Bullets & Taboo Integration ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Line 39: Updated database query to fetch `style_bullets` and `taboo` alongside `system_prompt`
- Lines 67-73: Added context builders that append style bullets and taboo topics to system prompt
- Lines 75-87: **NEW** - Updated emotion instructions to use narrative context instead of bracket tags

**Example system prompt:**
```
You are Warren Buffett...

Communication Style:
- Uses folksy metaphors and simple language
- Often references baseball and bridge
- Emphasizes long-term thinking

Topics to Avoid:
- Giving specific stock tips
- Making short-term predictions

IMPORTANT VOICE DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS:
When responding, use natural narrative context to indicate emotion and delivery style...
- For laughter: "she chuckled" or "with a laugh"
- For excitement: "said excitedly" or "with enthusiasm"
- For whispers: "whispered" or "softly"
```

### 3. Persona Generation Instructions Updated ✅
**File:** `src/lib/personas.ts`

**Changes:**
- Line 316: Updated systemPrompt generation to instruct Groq to use narrative context
- New personas will automatically be told to use phrases like "chuckled", "said thoughtfully", "pausing", etc.
- Explicitly instructs **NOT** to use bracket tags like `[chuckles]`

**Example instruction:**
> "IMPORTANT: Instruct the AI to use natural narrative context to convey emotion and delivery (e.g., 'said thoughtfully', 'chuckled', 'pausing', 'with enthusiasm', 'whispered'). This helps voice synthesis interpret emotional delivery without reading explicit tags aloud."

### 4. Enhanced Emotion Stripping Utility ✅
**File:** `src/lib/utils.ts`

**Updated function:**
```typescript
export function stripEmotionTags(text: string): string {
  // Removes both:
  // 1. Legacy bracket tags: [chuckles], [thoughtfully]
  // 2. Narrative context: "she chuckled", "he said excitedly", "with a laugh"
  // 3. Temporal markers: "after a moment", "pausing thoughtfully"
}
```

**Purpose:**
- Removes all emotion markers (both old and new formats)
- Cleans up narrative context for UI display
- Preserves the core dialogue content
- Used for UI display only - TTS receives full text with context

### 5. Clean UI Display ✅
**File:** `src/components/ChatList.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Line 8: Imported enhanced `stripEmotionTags` utility
- Line 106: Applied to message content before display

**Result:**
- Users see: "That's interesting. Well, based on my experience... it's not quite that simple."
- Database stores: "That's interesting," she chuckled. "Well, based on my experience..." She paused thoughtfully. "It's not quite that simple."

### 6. TTS Preservation ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/tts/route.ts`

**Status:** No changes needed
- Line 28: Text passed directly to ElevenLabs without modification
- Narrative context remains intact for voice modulation
- ElevenLabs interprets narrative cues naturally without reading them aloud

## Data Flow

### Persona Creation Flow:
```
User Input → Exa API (research) → Groq API (generate with narrative context instructions) 
→ Database (stores system_prompt with delivery guidance, style_bullets, taboo, description)
→ Voice Generation (if applicable)
```

### Chat Flow:
```
User Message → Database → Fetch persona (system_prompt, style_bullets, taboo)
→ Build enhanced prompt with narrative instructions → Groq API (generates response WITH narrative context)
→ Save to DB (with context) → Return to frontend
```

### Display Flow:
```
Message from DB (with narrative context) → ChatList component → stripEmotionTags()
→ Clean dialogue displayed to user
```

### TTS Flow:
```
Message from DB (with narrative context) → TTS API → ElevenLabs (interprets narrative naturally)
→ Audio with enhanced prosody → User hears expressive speech WITHOUT hearing "she chuckled"
```

## Example Response

**AI generates:**
```
"Oh, that's a fascinating question!" she said excitedly. "You know, I've been thinking about this for years." 
She paused thoughtfully. "The key is..." with a slight chuckle, "well, it's not as simple as most people think. 
Let me break it down for you."
```

**User sees in UI (cleaned):**
```
"Oh, that's a fascinating question! You know, I've been thinking about this for years. 
The key is... well, it's not as simple as most people think. Let me break it down for you."
```

**TTS receives (with full context):**
```
"Oh, that's a fascinating question!" she said excitedly. "You know, I've been thinking about this for years." 
She paused thoughtfully. "The key is..." with a slight chuckle, "well, it's not as simple as most people think. 
Let me break it down for you."
```

**User hears:** Natural speech with excitement, thoughtful pause, and slight chuckle - WITHOUT hearing the words "said excitedly", "paused thoughtfully", or "chuckled" spoken aloud.

## Supported Narrative Patterns

Common patterns the AI will use:

### Emotion Verbs:
- `said excitedly` / `said sarcastically` / `said softly`
- `chuckled` / `laughed` / `giggled`
- `whispered` / `murmured`
- `sighed` / `groaned`
- `continued` / `replied` / `responded`

### Temporal/Pause Markers:
- `after a moment`
- `pausing thoughtfully`
- `taking a breath`

### Prepositional Phrases:
- `with a laugh` / `with enthusiasm`
- `with obvious sarcasm`
- `with a sigh`

## Benefits of Narrative Context Approach

1. ✅ **No Audible Tags**: ElevenLabs interprets context naturally without reading markers aloud
2. ✅ **More Natural**: Narrative style sounds like natural storytelling
3. ✅ **Clean UI**: Stripping utility removes markers for polished display
4. ✅ **Better Control**: More nuanced emotional expression than bracket tags
5. ✅ **Standards Compliant**: Follows ElevenLabs official best practices
6. ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Still handles old bracket tags if present

6. ✅ `EMOTION_TAGS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Updated documentation

## Migration Path

### For Existing Personas with Bracket Tags:
The system now supports both formats:
- Old bracket tags `[chuckles]` will be stripped by UI
- New narrative context "chuckled" will also be stripped
- Both formats work with TTS (though narrative context works better)

### For New Personas:
All new personas created will use narrative context by default thanks to updated instructions in `personas.ts`.

## Technical Notes

- Narrative context format: `"dialogue," [subject] [verb] [adverb]. "more dialogue"`
- Regex patterns in `stripEmotionTags()` handle both legacy and new formats
- Database stores full text with context (original content preserved)
- Frontend strips markers client-side (no server overhead)
- ElevenLabs processes narrative context server-side without vocalizing markers
- Context is preserved in conversation history for continuity
