# STT API Fix Summary

## Problem
You were getting a **501 error** when trying to use the microphone for speech-to-text transcription. The error message was:
```
STT API error: 501
Mic error: "Failed to process audio. Please try again."
```

## Root Cause
The STT API endpoint (`/api/stt/route.ts`) was incorrectly sending audio data to ElevenLabs:
1. ❌ Sending raw audio buffer instead of multipart/form-data
2. ❌ No fallback to Groq Whisper API
3. ❌ Poor error logging made it hard to debug

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Fixed ElevenLabs STT Integration** ✅
- Changed from sending raw audio buffer to proper **multipart/form-data** format
- ElevenLabs expects the audio file to be sent with field name `'audio'`
- Added detailed error logging to see exactly what's failing

### 2. **Added Groq Whisper as Fallback** ✅
- Groq provides **free Whisper STT API** via their OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- If ElevenLabs fails, the system will automatically try Groq Whisper
- This gives you **two STT options** for better reliability

### 3. **Improved Error Messages** ✅
- Added Toast notification component to show user-friendly error messages
- Better error logging in the console for debugging
- More descriptive error messages

## Files Changed

### `/src/app/api/stt/route.ts`
```typescript
// Before: Raw audio buffer
body: audioBuffer

// After: Proper multipart/form-data
const sttFormData = new FormData();
sttFormData.append('audio', audioFile);
body: sttFormData
```

### `/src/components/Composer.tsx`
- Added Toast component import
- Added state for toast messages
- Now shows error toasts when microphone fails

## How to Test

1. **Open the app** at http://localhost:3000

2. **Click the microphone button** in the chat composer

3. **Allow microphone access** when prompted by your browser

4. **Speak clearly** for 2-3 seconds

5. **Stop recording** by clicking the mic button again

6. **You should see:**
   - ✅ Processing indicator while transcribing
   - ✅ Your transcribed text appears in the input field
   - OR if there's an error, a red toast notification with details

## Troubleshooting

### If it still doesn't work:

1. **Check your browser console** for detailed error messages:
   - Press F12 to open DevTools
   - Look for "ElevenLabs STT error:" or "Groq Whisper error:"

2. **Verify your API keys in `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   ELEVEN_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Check if ElevenLabs supports STT with your plan:**
   - Some ElevenLabs plans may not include STT
   - If ElevenLabs fails, Groq Whisper should work as fallback

4. **Test with a simple audio:**
   - Try saying something simple like "Hello world"
   - Speak clearly and not too fast
   - Make sure you're in a quiet environment

5. **Check microphone permissions:**
   - Make sure your browser has microphone access
   - Try a different browser if needed

## Technical Details

### ElevenLabs STT API
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/speech-to-text`
- **Method:** POST
- **Format:** multipart/form-data with 'audio' field
- **Supported formats:** audio/webm, audio/mpeg, audio/wav

### Groq Whisper API (Fallback)
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions`
- **Method:** POST
- **Model:** whisper-large-v3
- **Format:** multipart/form-data with 'file' field
- **Speed:** Very fast (~1-2 seconds for transcription)

## What's Next

If you're still experiencing issues:
1. Check the server console logs (where you ran `npm run dev`)
2. Look for error messages with status codes and response details
3. Verify your API keys are valid and have the right permissions
4. Consider using only Groq Whisper if ElevenLabs STT is not available in your plan
